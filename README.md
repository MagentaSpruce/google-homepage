This is the first project (with extra difficulty challenge included) for The Odin Project. It details a copied Google search and results page. 

***Edits needed: 
1) Centering the icons with their text in the header - correct text format
2) extend page divide across the entire page
3) Emulating the search bar properly - adding in the X and | symbols and spacing the icons and placeholder text correctly.
4) Fix the app popup
5) Fix Ad text
